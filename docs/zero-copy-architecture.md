# Zero-Copy Protocol Architecture

## Overview

The zero-copy protocol architecture is a comprehensive performance optimization system designed to minimize memory allocations and copying overhead in the PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation. This architecture achieves significant performance improvements through intelligent memory management and zero-copy data access patterns.

**Note**: The zero-copy optimizations described in this document have been fully integrated into the consolidated query executor (`src/query/executor.rs`). The separate experimental implementations referenced in earlier documentation have been removed as part of the codebase cleanup (July 2025).

## Architecture Components

### Phase 1: Memory-Mapped Value Access

**Purpose**: Eliminate memory copying for large data values through memory-mapped file access.

**Components**:
- `MappedValue`: Enum supporting Memory/Mapped/Reference variants for flexible data access

- `ValueHandler`: Smart SQLite-to-PostgreSQL value conversion system

**Benefits**:
- Zero-copy access for BLOB and TEXT data larger than configurable thresholds
- Reduced memory pressure for large query results
- Seamless integration with existing query processing

### Phase 2: Enhanced Protocol Writer System

**Purpose**: Eliminate framing overhead and provide direct socket communication.

**Components**:
- `ProtocolWriter`: Unified trait for all protocol message writing
- `DirectWriter`: Direct socket communication bypassing tokio-util framing

### Phase 4: Memory-Mapped Value Integration

**Purpose**: Deep integration of memory-mapped values throughout the query processing pipeline.

**Components**:
- `MemoryMappedExecutor`: Optimized query processing with memory mapping
- Smart value slicing and reference management
- Temporary file management for large value storage
- Configurable threshold system for mapping decisions

**Benefits**:
- Efficient handling of large data without memory copying
- Automatic threshold-based optimization
- Seamless integration with existing executors

### Phase 5: Reusable Message Buffers

**Purpose**: Eliminate allocation overhead through intelligent buffer pooling and memory management.

**Components**:
- `BufferPool`: Thread-safe buffer recycling with automatic size management
- `MemoryMonitor`: Memory pressure detection with configurable thresholds
- `PooledDirectWriter`: Enhanced DirectWriter with buffer pooling
- Intelligent message batching with configurable flush triggers
- Comprehensive monitoring and statistics tracking

**Benefits**:
- Zero-allocation message construction
- Intelligent memory pressure management
- Automatic cleanup and resource optimization
- Comprehensive performance monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The zero-copy architecture supports extensive configuration through environment variables:

#### Buffer Pool Configuration
```bash
# Buffer pool size (default: 50)
export PGSQLITE_BUFFER_POOL_SIZE=100

# Initial buffer capacity in bytes (default: 4096)
export PGSQLITE_BUFFER_INITIAL_CAPACITY=8192

# Maximum buffer capacity before discard (default: 65536)
export PGSQLITE_BUFFER_MAX_CAPACITY=131072

# Enable buffer pool monitoring (default: 0)
export PGSQLITE_BUFFER_MONITORING=1
```

#### Memory Monitor Configuration
```bash
# Memory threshold in bytes (default: 67108864)
export PGSQLITE_MEMORY_THRESHOLD=134217728

# High memory threshold in bytes (default: 134217728)
export PGSQLITE_HIGH_MEMORY_THRESHOLD=268435456

# Memory check interval in seconds (default: 10)
export PGSQLITE_MEMORY_CHECK_INTERVAL=5

# Enable automatic cleanup (default: 0)
export PGSQLITE_AUTO_CLEANUP=1

# Enable detailed memory monitoring (default: 0)
export PGSQLITE_MEMORY_MONITORING=1
```

export PGSQLITE_BATCH_SIZE=100

# Maximum batch bytes (default: 32768)
export PGSQLITE_BATCH_BYTES=65536

```bash
# Memory mapping threshold in bytes (default: 8192)
export PGSQLITE_MMAP_THRESHOLD=16384

# Enable memory mapping (default: 1)
export PGSQLITE_ENABLE_MMAP=1
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

The zero-copy architecture is automatically enabled when using the standard pgsqlite connection. The optimizations are integrated into the main query executor and do not require special configuration:

```rust
// Zero-copy optimizations are automatically applied by the query executor
// No special configuration needed - just use pgsqlite normally
```

### Advanced Configuration

The zero-copy optimizations can be configured through environment variables as shown above. The buffer pool and memory monitoring systems work automatically within the consolidated executor to provide optimal performance.

### Monitoring and Statistics

```rust
use pgsqlite::protocol::{global_buffer_pool, global_memory_monitor};

// Get buffer pool statistics
let pool_stats = global_buffer_pool().get_stats();
println!("Buffer pool efficiency: {:.1}%", pool_stats.reuse_rate());
println!("Current pool size: {}", pool_stats.current_pool_size);

// Get memory monitor statistics
let memory_stats = global_memory_monitor().get_stats();
println!("Total memory usage: {} bytes", memory_stats.total_bytes());
println!("Memory pressure: {:?}", memory_stats.pressure_level);
```

## Testing

The zero-copy architecture includes comprehensive test coverage integrated into the main test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests including zero-copy components
cargo test

# Run specific component tests
cargo test protocol::buffer_pool::tests
cargo test protocol::memory_monitor::tests
cargo test protocol::value_handler::tests
```

## Future Optimization Opportunities
