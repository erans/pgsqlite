# Future Features Roadmap

This document outlines potential features that could enhance pgsqlite by working within SQLite's constraints to provide better PostgreSQL compatibility and performance.

## 1. Write Queue & Batching System

### Problem
SQLite only allows one writer at a time, causing "database locked" errors for concurrent writes.

### Solution
- Queue concurrent write requests instead of failing immediately
- Batch multiple writes together in single transactions
- Configurable batch size and time windows (e.g., batch up to 100 writes or 10ms)
- Priority queuing for critical writes
- Return PostgreSQL-compatible transaction IDs immediately

### Benefits
- Dramatically improved concurrent write performance
- Better user experience (no immediate failures)
- Optimal use of SQLite's write capabilities

## 2. Multi-Database Router

### Problem
PostgreSQL supports multiple databases per server instance, SQLite doesn't.

### Solution
- Support `CREATE DATABASE` / `DROP DATABASE` commands
- Map each database name to a separate SQLite file
- Route connections based on database parameter
- Maintain a registry of databases in a metadata SQLite file
- Support PostgreSQL's `\l` command to list databases

### Benefits
- True multi-tenant isolation
- Easy per-database backups
- Compatible with PostgreSQL tooling expectations
- Simple database cloning (just copy the file)

## 3. Read Replica Architecture

### Problem
SQLite's single-writer limitation affects read scalability under write load.

### Solution
- Maintain read-only copies using SQLite's backup API
- Route SELECT queries to replicas, writes to primary
- Configurable replication lag tolerance
- Automatic replica promotion on primary failure
- Load balancing across multiple replicas

### Benefits
- Horizontal read scaling
- Zero-downtime backups from replicas
- Improved read performance during writes
- High availability option

## 4. Smart Connection Management

### Problem
Current connection handling doesn't optimize for SQLite's characteristics.

### Solution
- Separate read and write connection pools
- Fair queuing for write operations with timeouts
- Connection priorities and weights
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Pre-warmed connections with cached metadata
- Configurable max wait times

### Benefits
- Better resource utilization
- Improved fairness under load
- Reduced connection overhead
- Better error handling

## 5. Time-Travel Queries

### Problem
No built-in way to query historical data in SQLite.

### Solution
- Leverage SQLite's WAL for historical queries
- Support: `SELECT * FROM users AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-01-01'`
- Configurable retention periods
- Automatic old WAL cleanup
- Optional separate history database

### Benefits
- Powerful debugging capabilities
- Audit trail functionality
- Undo capabilities for applications
- Compliance with data retention requirements

## 6. Automatic Table Sharding

### Problem
Large tables can exceed SQLite's practical size limits.

### Solution
- Transparent sharding across multiple SQLite files
- Hash or range-based partitioning
- Parallel query execution across shards
- Automatic shard rebalancing
- Shard-aware query optimization

### Benefits
- Overcome SQLite size limitations
- Better performance for large datasets
- Parallel query execution
- Easier maintenance of large tables

## 7. Observability & Monitoring

### Problem
Limited visibility into pgsqlite's operation and performance.

### Solution
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Built-in query performance tracking
- Lock contention monitoring
- Slow query log with explain plans
- Database growth tracking
- Connection pool statistics
- Cache hit rate metrics

### Benefits
- Production-ready monitoring
- Performance troubleshooting
- Capacity planning data
- SLA monitoring

## 8. SQLite Management Interface

### Problem
No easy way to manage SQLite-specific features through PostgreSQL protocol.

### Solution
- Web-based admin interface at `/admin`
- PRAGMA configuration management
- Automatic VACUUM scheduling
- Index usage statistics
- Visual query plan analysis
- Live performance metrics
- Database file management

### Benefits
- Easy SQLite administration
- Visual performance tuning
- Reduced operational overhead
- Better debugging tools

## 9. Change Data Capture (CDC)

### Problem
No native way to stream changes from SQLite.

### Solution
- Trigger-based change capture
- Stream to Kafka/Redis/webhooks
- Debezium-compatible format
- Configurable filters and transformations
- At-least-once delivery guarantees
- Change buffering during downstream outages

### Benefits
- Enable event-driven architectures
- Real-time cache invalidation
- Data pipeline integration
- Audit logging

## 10. Query Routing & Optimization

### Problem
All queries treated equally regardless of characteristics.

### Solution
- Automatic read/write query detection
- Route analytical queries to replicas
- Custom routing rules via configuration
- Query pattern learning
- Automatic index recommendations
- Query result pre-computation

### Benefits
- Better resource utilization
- Improved query performance
- Reduced primary database load
- Self-tuning capabilities

## 11. Advanced Backup & Recovery

### Problem
Limited backup options for production use.

### Solution
- Continuous incremental backups
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR)
- Backup to S3/cloud storage
- Parallel backup streams
- Backup verification and testing
- One-command disaster recovery
- Cross-region replication

### Benefits
- Production-grade data protection
- Compliance with backup requirements
- Minimal performance impact
- Quick recovery options

## 12. Streaming & Cursors

### Problem
Large result sets consume excessive memory.

### Solution
- True cursor support with `DECLARE CURSOR`
- Streaming result sets
- Configurable fetch sizes
- Automatic pagination
- Memory-limited result buffering
- Async result streaming

### Benefits
- Handle arbitrary large results
- Reduced memory usage
- Better performance for exports
- PostgreSQL cursor compatibility
