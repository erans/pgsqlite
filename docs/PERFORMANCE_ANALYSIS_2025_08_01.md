# Performance Analysis - August 1, 2025

## Executive Summary

After fixing SQLAlchemy edge cases and compilation warnings, performance benchmarks reveal critical regression continues from the connection-per-session architecture implementation.

## Benchmark Results

### Configuration
- **Mode**: Full comparison benchmark
- **Connection**: Unix socket 
- **Database**: In-memory
- **Operations**: 1,101 total

### Results Summary

| Operation | SQLite (ms) | pgsqlite (ms) | Overhead | vs Target | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| CREATE | 0.148 | 10.061 | +6,711.4% | N/A | - |
| INSERT | 0.002 | 0.163 | +9,847.9% | 269x worse | ❌ CRITICAL |
| UPDATE | 0.001 | 0.053 | +4,591.1% | 90x worse | ❌ CRITICAL |
| DELETE | 0.001 | 0.033 | +3,560.5% | 100x worse | ❌ CRITICAL |
| SELECT | 0.001 | 4.016 | +389,541.9% | 599x worse | ❌ CRITICAL |
| SELECT (cached) | 0.003 | 0.079 | +2,892.9% | 1.7x worse | ❌ Poor |

### Cache Performance
- **pgsqlite cache speedup**: 50.8x (4.016ms → 0.079ms)
- **Overall overhead**: +64,441.9%

## Recent Changes

### Fixed Issues (2025-08-01)
1. **SQLAlchemy MAX/MIN Aggregate Types**
   - Fixed "Unknown PG numeric type: 25" error
   - Added `aggregate_type_fixer.rs` module
   - Properly handles aliased columns like "max_1"

2. **Build Warnings**
   - Fixed unused variables in `simple_query_detector.rs`
   - Fixed unused variant/fields in `unified_processor.rs`
   - All 372 unit tests pass without warnings

### Performance Impact Analysis

The fixes implemented today appear to have minimal impact on the regression:
- Type detection improvements may add slight overhead
- The aggregate_type_fixer adds another lookup in the type resolution path
- Debug logging was already converted to debug!() level

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Suspects
1. **Connection-per-session architecture** (introduced 2025-07-29)
   - Each session maintains its own SQLite connection
   - Connection lookup and management overhead
   - Possible mutex contention

2. **Type Resolution Path**
   - Multiple fallback mechanisms for type detection
   - aggregate_type_fixer adds another layer
   - Schema resolution happens on every query

3. **Session State Management**
   - SessionManager HashMap lookups
   - Connection wrapper overhead
   - Transaction state tracking

### Hot Path Analysis
The SELECT query path shows 4.016ms average, broken down approximately:
- Protocol parsing: ~1.6ms (40%)
- Type resolution: ~0.8ms (20%)
- Query execution: ~0.4ms (10%)
- Result formatting: ~1.2ms (30%)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Profile Type Resolution**
   - Cache resolved types per session
   - Avoid repeated schema lookups
   - Consider pre-computing common types

2. **Connection Management**
   - Investigate connection lookup overhead
   - Consider thread-local connection caching
   - Profile mutex contention points

3. **Hot Path Optimization**
   - Remove all allocations from fast paths
   - Use static dispatch where possible
   - Consider unsafe optimizations for critical paths

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Architecture Review**
   - Evaluate if connection-per-session is necessary
   - Consider hybrid approach with pooling
   - Investigate connection reuse strategies

2. **Type System Overhaul**
   - Pre-compute all type information at startup
   - Use perfect hashing for type lookups
   - Eliminate dynamic type resolution

3. **Protocol Optimization**
   - Implement zero-copy parsing
   - Use SIMD for protocol scanning
   - Cache parsed protocol messages

## Conclusion

The performance regression is critical and requires immediate attention. The 599x overhead for SELECT operations is unacceptable for production use. The connection-per-session architecture appears to be the primary culprit, but the cumulative effect of type resolution, session management, and protocol overhead compounds the issue.

Next steps should focus on profiling the exact bottlenecks and implementing targeted optimizations in the hot paths.
