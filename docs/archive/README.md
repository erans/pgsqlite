This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer current but is preserved for reference.

## Archived Files

### zero-copy-architecture-plan.md
- **Date Archived**: July 3, 2025
- **Reason**: Initial planning document that was superseded by actual implementation
- **Status**: The zero-copy optimizations were successfully implemented but integrated differently than originally planned

### zero-copy-implementation-summary.md
- **Date Archived**: July 3, 2025
- **Reason**: Documents an incomplete experimental implementation that was replaced
- **Status**: The final implementation used a consolidated executor approach rather than separate zero-copy modules

## Current State

The zero-copy optimizations described in these documents were successfully implemented and integrated into the main query executor (`src/query/executor.rs`). The performance improvements were achieved (8.5x-10x overhead for cached SELECT queries) but through a simpler, consolidated architecture rather than the modular approach originally planned.

For current documentation on the zero-copy architecture, see `../zero-copy-architecture.md`.
