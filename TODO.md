# pgsqlite TODO List

## How to Use This TODO List

This file tracks all future development tasks for the pgsqlite project. It serves as a comprehensive roadmap for features, improvements, and fixes that need to be implemented.

### Adding New Tasks
- Add new tasks under the appropriate section or create a new section if needed
- Use the checkbox format: `- [ ] Task description`
- Be specific and actionable in task descriptions
- Include technical details when helpful (e.g., "Store in __pgsqlite_schema table")
- Group related tasks under subsections for better organization

### Marking Tasks as Complete
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when a task is fully implemented and tested
- Only mark as complete when the feature is:
  - Fully implemented with all edge cases handled
  - Tested and working correctly
  - Integrated with the existing codebase
  - Documentation updated if needed

### Removing Completed Tasks
- Remove tasks from this list ONLY when they are completely done
- Do not remove tasks that are partially complete or have known issues
- Keep completed tasks marked with `[x]` temporarily for tracking, then remove during periodic cleanup
- If a task reveals additional subtasks during implementation, add those subtasks before removing the parent task

### Task Priority
- Tasks are roughly organized by importance and logical implementation order
- High-priority items that affect core functionality are listed first
- Consider dependencies between tasks when planning implementation

## Type System Enhancements

### Code Quality - Magic Numbers
- [ ] Replace OID type magic numbers with PgType enum values (e.g., replace hardcoded 1700 for Numeric with proper enum references)

### Schema Validation and Drift Detection
- [ ] Implement schema drift detection between __pgsqlite_schema and actual SQLite tables
- [ ] Check for mismatches on connection startup/first query
- [ ] Return appropriate PostgreSQL error when drift is detected
- [ ] Handle cases where columns exist in SQLite but not in __pgsqlite_schema
- [ ] Handle cases where __pgsqlite_schema has columns missing from SQLite table
- [ ] Validate column types match between schema metadata and SQLite PRAGMA table_info

### VARCHAR/NVARCHAR Length Constraints
- [ ] Store VARCHAR(n) and NVARCHAR(n) length constraints in __pgsqlite_schema
- [ ] Validate string lengths on INSERT/UPDATE operations
- [ ] Return proper PostgreSQL error when length constraints are violated
- [ ] Handle character vs byte length for multi-byte encodings

### NUMERIC/DECIMAL Precision and Scale
- [ ] Store NUMERIC(p,s) precision and scale in __pgsqlite_schema
- [ ] Enforce precision and scale constraints on INSERT/UPDATE
- [ ] Format decimal values according to specified scale before returning results
- [ ] Handle rounding/truncation according to PostgreSQL behavior

### Decimal Query Rewriting - Cast Detection
- [ ] Implement implicit cast detection in decimal query rewriting
- [ ] Handle implicit casts in comparisons (e.g., `integer_column = '123.45'`)

- [ ] Support type promotion in arithmetic operations (integer + decimal -> decimal)
- [ ] Handle assignment casts in INSERT/UPDATE statements
- [ ] Implement full PostgreSQL-style implicit cast analysis in ExpressionTypeResolver

### Decimal Query Rewriting - Context Handling
- [x] Fixed correlated subquery context inheritance (outer table columns now properly recognized in subqueries)
- [x] Improved aggregate function decimal wrapping (only wrap NUMERIC types, not FLOAT types)
- [x] Enhanced derived table decimal type propagation for WHERE clause rewriting
- [x] Fixed recursive CTE decimal rewriting (arithmetic operations in recursive part of UNION now properly rewritten)
- [ ] Optimize context merging performance for deeply nested subqueries

### CHAR Type Support
- [ ] Implement CHAR(n) with proper blank-padding behavior
- [ ] Store fixed length in __pgsqlite_schema
- [ ] Pad values to specified length on storage
- [ ] Handle comparison semantics (trailing space handling)

## Data Type Improvements

### Date/Time Types

- [ ] Cursor support with FETCH
- [ ] Row count limits in Execute messages

## Query Features

### CTEs and Subqueries
- [x] Recursive CTE decimal rewriting support (fixed table alias resolution for recursive parts)
