# pgsqlite TODO List

## âœ… Performance Optimization - COMPLETED (2025-06-30)

### Background
Investigated replacing the channel-based DbHandler with a direct multi-threaded implementation using SQLite's FULLMUTEX mode.

### Performance Findings
Benchmark results comparing implementations (1000 operations each):

| Implementation | INSERT | SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | Notes |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Raw SQLite | 0.005ms | 0.006ms | 0.005ms | 0.004ms | Baseline |
| Mutex Handler | 0.036ms | 0.046ms | 0.040ms | 0.038ms | 7.7-9.6x overhead (CHOSEN) |
| Direct Executor | 0.038ms | 0.050ms | 0.043ms | 0.042ms | 8.1-10.7x overhead |
| Simple Executor | 0.036ms | 0.047ms | 0.040ms | 0.039ms | 7.7-9.9x overhead |
| Channel-based | 0.094ms | 0.159ms | 0.092ms | 0.083ms | 20-27x overhead |

**Key Achievement**: Mutex-based implementation provides 2.2-3.5x performance improvement over channels.

### Final Implementation
[x] Implemented and deployed **Mutex-based DbHandler** as the sole database handler:
- Uses `parking_lot::Mutex` for efficient synchronization
- Single SQLite connection with `SQLITE_OPEN_FULL_MUTEX` flag
- Thread-safe and Send+Sync compatible
- Maintains all features: schema cache, fast path optimization, transaction support

### Work Completed
- [x] Benchmarked multiple implementations (channel, direct, simple, mutex)
- [x] Created mutex-based implementation with best performance characteristics
- [x] Removed all experimental implementations (direct_handler, simple_executor, etc.)
- [x] Updated session module to use single DbHandler implementation
- [x] Documented architectural decision in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Cleaned up codebase to remove unused modules

### Architectural Decision Rationale
Chose mutex-based approach because:
1. Best performance (7.7-9.6x overhead vs 20-27x for channels)
2. Simplest implementation (single connection, no pool complexity)
3. Thread-safe through parking_lot::Mutex + SQLite FULLMUTEX
4. Minimal code changes required
5. Trade-offs acceptable (no parallel reads, potential mutex contention under extreme load)

# pgsqlite TODO List

## How to Use This TODO List

This file tracks all future development tasks for the pgsqlite project. It serves as a comprehensive roadmap for features, improvements, and fixes that need to be implemented.

### Adding New Tasks
- Add new tasks under the appropriate section or create a new section if needed
- Use the checkbox format: `- [ ] Task description`
- Be specific and actionable in task descriptions
- Include technical details when helpful (e.g., "Store in __pgsqlite_schema table")
- Group related tasks under subsections for better organization

### Marking Tasks as Complete
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when a task is fully implemented and tested
- Only mark as complete when the feature is:
  - Fully implemented with all edge cases handled
  - Tested and working correctly
  - Integrated with the existing codebase
  - Documentation updated if needed

### Removing Completed Tasks
- Remove tasks from this list ONLY when they are completely done
- Do not remove tasks that are partially complete or have known issues
- Keep completed tasks marked with `[x]` temporarily for tracking, then remove during periodic cleanup
- If a task reveals additional subtasks during implementation, add those subtasks before removing the parent task

### Task Priority
- Tasks are roughly organized by importance and logical implementation order
- High-priority items that affect core functionality are listed first
- Consider dependencies between tasks when planning implementation
