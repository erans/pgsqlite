# pgsqlite TODO List

## ‚úÖ Performance Optimization Phase 1 - COMPLETED (2025-06-30)

### Background
Investigated replacing the channel-based DbHandler with a direct multi-threaded implementation using SQLite's FULLMUTEX mode.

### Performance Findings
Benchmark results comparing implementations (1000 operations each):

| Implementation | INSERT | SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | Notes |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Raw SQLite | 0.005ms | 0.006ms | 0.005ms | 0.004ms | Baseline |
| Mutex Handler | 0.036ms | 0.046ms | 0.040ms | 0.038ms | 7.7-9.6x overhead (CHOSEN) |
| Direct Executor | 0.038ms | 0.050ms | 0.043ms | 0.042ms | 8.1-10.7x overhead |
| Simple Executor | 0.036ms | 0.047ms | 0.040ms | 0.039ms | 7.7-9.9x overhead |
| Channel-based | 0.094ms | 0.159ms | 0.092ms | 0.083ms | 20-27x overhead |

**Key Achievement**: Mutex-based implementation provides 2.2-3.5x performance improvement over channels.

### Final Implementation
[x] Implemented and deployed **Mutex-based DbHandler** as the sole database handler:
- Uses `parking_lot::Mutex` for efficient synchronization
- Single SQLite connection with `SQLITE_OPEN_FULL_MUTEX` flag
- Thread-safe and Send+Sync compatible
- Maintains all features: schema cache, fast path optimization, transaction support

### Work Completed
- [x] Benchmarked multiple implementations (channel, direct, simple, mutex)
- [x] Created mutex-based implementation with best performance characteristics
- [x] Removed all experimental implementations (direct_handler, simple_executor, etc.)
- [x] Updated session module to use single DbHandler implementation
- [x] Documented architectural decision in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Cleaned up codebase to remove unused modules

### Architectural Decision Rationale
Chose mutex-based approach because:
1. Best performance (7.7-9.6x overhead vs 20-27x for channels)
2. Simplest implementation (single connection, no pool complexity)
3. Thread-safe through parking_lot::Mutex + SQLite FULLMUTEX
4. Minimal code changes required
5. Trade-offs acceptable (no parallel reads, potential mutex contention under extreme load)

## üöÄ Performance Optimization Phase 2 - SELECT Query Optimization

### Current State
Real-world benchmarks show SELECT queries have ~98x overhead vs raw SQLite, making them the second-slowest operation after INSERT.

### Root Causes

## üéâ Zero-Copy Protocol Architecture - FULLY COMPLETED (2025-07-01)

## ‚úÖ Protocol Flush Fix - COMPLETED (2025-07-02)

### Background
INSERT operations showed 159x overhead despite fast path optimizations achieving 1.0x-1.5x execution overhead. Investigation revealed missing `flush()` calls in the PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation.

### Root Cause
The `tokio_util::codec::Framed` writer doesn't automatically flush messages. Without explicit `flush()` calls after `ReadyForQuery` messages, responses were delayed by ~40ms waiting for:
- Client timeout and Flush message
- Buffer to fill up
- Next incoming message

### Implementation
- [x] Added `framed.flush().await?` after ReadyForQuery in simple query protocol (main.rs:276)
- [x] Added `framed.flush().await?` after ReadyForQuery in Sync handling (lib.rs:228)

### Performance Results
**Before flush fix:**
- INSERT: ~159x overhead (40ms+ delay per operation)
- SELECT (cached): ~8.5x overhead
- Overall: ~71x overhead

**After flush fix (Latest Benchmark):**
- INSERT: ~177x overhead (0.286ms) - no more 40ms delays
- SELECT: ~180x overhead (0.187ms) - protocol overhead visible
- SELECT (cached): ~17x overhead (0.094ms) - 2.0x cache speedup
- UPDATE: ~34x overhead (0.041ms) - excellent
- DELETE: ~39x overhead (0.038ms) - excellent
- Overall: ~98x overhead

### Key Achievement
Removed artificial 40ms delay per operation by adding flush() calls after ReadyForQuery messages. Direct TCP tests show ~47¬µs latency for simple queries. The remaining overhead is genuine PostgreSQL wire protocol translation cost.

## üéâ Zero-Copy Protocol Architecture - FULLY COMPLETED (2025-07-01)

### Background

## üöß SELECT Query Optimization - Logging Reduction (2025-07-02)

### Background
SELECT queries showed ~82x overhead with excessive error logging for missing schema metadata causing performance issues.

### Work Completed
- [x] Profiled SELECT query execution to identify logging bottlenecks
- [x] Changed error! and warn! logging to debug! level for missing metadata in:
  - src/query/executor.rs (lines 126, 131, 422, 437)
  - src/query/executor_v2.rs (lines 117, 122)
  - src/query/executor_memory_mapped.rs (lines 150, 155)
  - src/query/extended.rs (lines 698, 734, 1524)
- [x] Reduced logging overhead for user tables without schema metadata

### Impact
Missing metadata logging is now at debug level, reducing noise for legitimate cases where schema information is unavailable. This is particularly important for:
- Dynamic queries without explicit type information
- Tables created outside pgsqlite
- Queries using type inference

### Performance Results
**After logging reduction (2025-07-02):**
- SELECT: ~125ms (was ~187ms) - **33% improvement**
- SELECT (cached): ~80ms (was ~94ms) - **15% improvement**
- Overall overhead: ~84x (was ~98x) - **14% improvement**

The logging reduction provided measurable performance gains, particularly for uncached SELECT queries.

### Next Steps
- [x] Benchmark impact of logging reduction on SELECT performance - 33% improvement achieved
- [x] Implement RowDescription caching to avoid repeated field generation - 41% improvement achieved
- [ ] Remove remaining debug logging from hot paths
- [ ] Profile protocol serialization overhead
- [ ] Consider lazy schema loading for better startup performance

### RowDescription Cache Implementation (2025-07-02)
- [x] Created RowDescriptionCache with LRU eviction and TTL support
- [x] Integrated cache into all query executors (simple, v2, extended protocol)
- [x] Cache key includes query, table name, and column names for accuracy
- [x] Added environment variables for cache configuration:
  - PGSQLITE_ROW_DESC_CACHE_SIZE (default: 1000 entries)
  - PGSQLITE_ROW_DESC_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES (default: 10 minutes)

### Combined Optimization Results (2025-07-02)
**After logging reduction + RowDescription caching:**
- SELECT: ~82ms (was ~187ms) - **56% total improvement**
- SELECT (cached): ~47ms (was ~94ms) - **50% total improvement**
- Overall overhead: ~46x (was ~98x) - **53% total improvement**

The combination of logging reduction and RowDescription caching has cut SELECT query overhead in half!

### Debug Logging Investigation (2025-07-02)
Investigated removing debug! calls from hot paths but found:
- Debug macros are already compiled out in release builds with log level "error"
- No measurable performance impact from removing debug! statements
- The tracing crate's macros are zero-cost when disabled
- Keeping debug logs for development/troubleshooting has no production impact

## ‚úÖ Performance Optimization Phase 6 - INSERT Operation Optimization - COMPLETED (2025-07-02)

### Background
INSERT operations showed the highest overhead (~200x) in benchmarks, making them the biggest performance bottleneck.

### Work Completed

#### Fast Path for INSERT

### Performance Results
- **Single-row INSERT**: ~170x overhead (0.290ms) - Protocol translation limitation
- **UPDATE**: ~32x overhead (0.041ms) - Excellent performance  
- **DELETE**: ~35x overhead (0.037ms) - Excellent performance
- **Statement Pool**: Near-native performance (1.0x-1.5x overhead in tests)

## ‚úÖ Batch INSERT Performance - DISCOVERED (2025-07-02)

### Background
INSERT operations showed 177x overhead for single-row operations. Investigated multi-row INSERT support to amortize protocol overhead.

### Key Discovery
Multi-row VALUES syntax is **already fully supported** - no implementation needed! The SQL parser and execution engine handle batch INSERTs natively.

### Performance Results
Benchmark with 1000 total rows:
- **Single-row INSERTs**: 65ms (15,378 rows/sec) - 6.7x overhead
- **10-row batches**: 5.7ms (176,610 rows/sec) - 11.5x speedup  
- **100-row batches**: 1.3ms (788,200 rows/sec) - 51.3x speedup
- **1000-row batch**: 0.85ms (1,174,938 rows/sec) - 76.4x speedup

**Remarkable finding**: Batch sizes ‚â•10 actually **outperform direct SQLite** (0.1-0.6x overhead)!

### Usage Example
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES 
  ('Alice', 'alice@example.com', 25),
  ('Bob', 'bob@example.com', 30),
  ('Charlie', 'charlie@example.com', 35);
```

### Recommendation
For bulk INSERT operations, always use multi-row VALUES syntax. The protocol overhead is amortized across all rows in the batch, providing near-native or better performance.
