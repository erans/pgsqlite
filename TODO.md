# pgsqlite TODO List

## How to Use This TODO List

This file tracks all future development tasks for the pgsqlite project. It serves as a comprehensive roadmap for features, improvements, and fixes that need to be implemented.

### Adding New Tasks
- Add new tasks under the appropriate section or create a new section if needed
- Use the checkbox format: `- [ ] Task description`
- Be specific and actionable in task descriptions
- Include technical details when helpful (e.g., "Store in __pgsqlite_schema table")
- Group related tasks under subsections for better organization

### Marking Tasks as Complete
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when a task is fully implemented and tested
- Only mark as complete when the feature is:
  - Fully implemented with all edge cases handled
  - Tested and working correctly
  - Integrated with the existing codebase
  - Documentation updated if needed

### Removing Completed Tasks
- Remove tasks from this list ONLY when they are completely done
- Do not remove tasks that are partially complete or have known issues
- Keep completed tasks marked with `[x]` temporarily for tracking, then remove during periodic cleanup
- If a task reveals additional subtasks during implementation, add those subtasks before removing the parent task

### Task Priority
- Tasks are roughly organized by importance and logical implementation order
- High-priority items that affect core functionality are listed first
- Consider dependencies between tasks when planning implementation
