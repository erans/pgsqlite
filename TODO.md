# pgsqlite TODO List

## How to Use This TODO List

This file tracks all future development tasks for the pgsqlite project. It serves as a comprehensive roadmap for features, improvements, and fixes that need to be implemented.

### Adding New Tasks
- Add new tasks under the appropriate section or create a new section if needed
- Use the checkbox format: `- [ ] Task description`
- Be specific and actionable in task descriptions
- Include technical details when helpful (e.g., "Store in __pgsqlite_schema table")
- Group related tasks under subsections for better organization

### Marking Tasks as Complete
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when a task is fully implemented and tested
- Only mark as complete when the feature is:
  - Fully implemented with all edge cases handled
  - Tested and working correctly
  - Integrated with the existing codebase
  - Documentation updated if needed

### Removing Completed Tasks
- Remove tasks from this list ONLY when they are completely done
- Do not remove tasks that are partially complete or have known issues
- Keep completed tasks marked with `[x]` temporarily for tracking, then remove during periodic cleanup
- If a task reveals additional subtasks during implementation, add those subtasks before removing the parent task

### Task Priority
- Tasks are roughly organized by importance and logical implementation order
- High-priority items that affect core functionality are listed first
- Consider dependencies between tasks when planning implementation

#### Work Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive research document (docs/pg_catalog_research.md)
  - Documented PostgreSQL catalog table structures
  - Analyzed psql \d command queries
  - Mapped SQLite metadata to PostgreSQL catalogs
- [x] Implemented pg_class handler (src/catalog/pg_class.rs)
  - Maps SQLite tables and indexes to pg_class format
  - Generates stable OIDs from object names
  - Queries SQLite metadata for relnatts, relhasindex
  - Returns all 28 pg_class columns with appropriate values
- [x] Implemented pg_attribute handler (src/catalog/pg_attribute.rs)
  - Maps PRAGMA table_info to pg_attribute format

3. **No JOIN Support** - Cannot handle psql's complex JOIN queries
4. **Missing System Functions** - COMPLETED (2025-07-04)
5. **Incomplete Catalog Tables** - Need pg_index, pg_constraint, pg_am, etc.

- psql can connect and query catalogs but \d commands show raw data
- Need proper query processing for full psql compatibility

### 🎯 PostgreSQL Regex Operators Support - COMPLETED (2025-07-08)

#### Background

  - Preserves query structure while translating operators
- [x] Registered REGEXP and REGEXPI functions in SQLite
  - Uses Rust's regex crate for pattern matching
  - REGEXP for case-sensitive matching
  - REGEXPI for case-insensitive matching
- [x] Integrated into query processing pipeline

  - regclass type casting: converts table names to OIDs
  - pg_get_userbyid: returns user name (always 'sqlite')
- [x] Fixed migration system
  - Functions registered before running migrations
  - Handles both new and existing databases correctly
  - In-memory databases auto-migrate on startup

#### Current Status
- Infrastructure complete for psql \d command
- Catalog tables properly created and populated
- JOIN queries execute successfully
- Regex operators work correctly
- Schema prefixes handled transparently

### ✅ System Catalog Extended Protocol Support - COMPLETED (2025-07-05)

#### Background
Catalog queries were failing with UnexpectedMessage errors when using the extended protocol (prepared statements). This affected tools that use prepared statements to query system catalogs.

#### Issues Fixed
1. **pg_class Column Count**: Updated from 28 to 33 columns per PostgreSQL 14+ specification
   - Added missing columns: reloftype, relallvisible, relacl, reloptions, relpartbound
   - Updated all related type mappings and handlers

2. **Extended Protocol Field Descriptions**: Fixed UnexpectedMessage errors
   - Field descriptions generated during Describe phase are now properly stored in prepared statements
   - Available during Execute phase for correct protocol handling
   - Catalog queries now work correctly with both simple and extended protocols

3. **Binary Encoding Support**: Fixed "invalid buffer size" errors
   - Catalog data is now properly formatted for binary result encoding
   - Added special handling for numeric columns (attnum, attlen, etc.)
   - PRIMARY KEY columns are correctly identified as NOT NULL

4. **Column Projection**: Implemented for pg_attribute handler
   - SELECT specific columns now returns only those columns
   - Handles wildcard (*) and column aliases correctly
   - Fixed test failures related to column index mismatches

5. **Test Infrastructure**: Improved diagnostic test handling
   - Trace tests that intentionally panic are now marked with #[ignore]
   - Can still be run manually for debugging with --ignored flag
