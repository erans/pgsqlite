# pgsqlite TODO List

## How to Use This TODO List

This file tracks all future development tasks for the pgsqlite project. It serves as a comprehensive roadmap for features, improvements, and fixes that need to be implemented.

### Adding New Tasks
- Add new tasks under the appropriate section or create a new section if needed
- Use the checkbox format: `- [ ] Task description`
- Be specific and actionable in task descriptions
- Include technical details when helpful (e.g., "Store in __pgsqlite_schema table")
- Group related tasks under subsections for better organization

### Marking Tasks as Complete
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when a task is fully implemented and tested
- Only mark as complete when the feature is:
  - Fully implemented with all edge cases handled
  - Tested and working correctly
  - Integrated with the existing codebase
  - Documentation updated if needed

### Removing Completed Tasks
- Remove tasks from this list ONLY when they are completely done
- Do not remove tasks that are partially complete or have known issues
- Keep completed tasks marked with `[x]` temporarily for tracking, then remove during periodic cleanup
- If a task reveals additional subtasks during implementation, add those subtasks before removing the parent task

### Task Priority
- Tasks are roughly organized by importance and logical implementation order
- High-priority items that affect core functionality are listed first
- Consider dependencies between tasks when planning implementation

  - [x] **Root Cause**: SQLite doesn't support VALUES in FROM clause with column aliases
  - [x] **Solution**: Convert VALUES pattern to UNION ALL syntax that SQLite understands
  - [x] **Impact**: SQLAlchemy ORM bulk inserts now work correctly with type preservation
- [x] **JOIN Query Type Inference** - Fixed columns returning TEXT instead of proper types
  - [x] **Bug Identified**: JOIN queries returned all columns as TEXT (OID 25) breaking numeric operations

  - [x] **Bug Identified**: SELECT queries with column aliases (e.g., `users.birth_date AS users_birth_date`) returned raw INTEGER values
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Datetime conversion was only applied in ultra-simple query path, not normal SELECT path
  - [x] **Solution**: Enhanced `convert_array_data_in_rows()` to handle datetime types based on type OIDs
  - [x] **Impact**: SQLAlchemy ORM queries now return properly formatted datetime objects instead of integers
- [x] **Technical Implementation**:

### SQLAlchemy Compatibility Fixes - MAJOR PROGRESS (2025-08-06)
- [x] **Transaction Isolation Bug Fix** - Fixed schema visibility in same transaction
  - [x] **Bug Identified**: get_schema_type() used separate connection that couldn't see uncommitted schema entries
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Schema lookups in same transaction couldn't see tables created but not yet committed
  - [x] **Solution**: Created get_schema_type_with_session() that uses session's connection
  - [x] **Implementation**: Updated 20 call sites across extended.rs and executor.rs to use session-aware version
  - [x] **Impact**: Timestamps now properly detected and formatted instead of returned as raw microseconds
- [x] **Ultra-fast Path Parameter Cast Support** - Fixed timestamp conversion bypass
  - [x] **Bug Identified**: Queries with parameter casts like `$1::INTEGER` bypassed ultra-fast path
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Ultra-fast path excluded all queries containing "::" operator
  - [x] **Solution**: Modified condition to allow parameter casts while excluding non-parameter casts
  - [x] **Implementation**: Uses regex to differentiate `$1::TYPE` from other cast operations
  - [x] **Impact**: SQLAlchemy queries with parameter casts now get proper timestamp conversion
- [x] **AVG Aggregate Type Detection** - Fixed "Unknown PG numeric type: 25" errors for aggregate functions
  - [x] **Bug Identified**: AVG/MAX/MIN aggregate functions returned TEXT type OID (25) instead of NUMERIC (1700)
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Type inference didn't recognize aggregate function aliases like "avg_views" from query context
  - [x] **Solution**: Enhanced `get_aggregate_return_type_with_query()` to parse query context and detect aggregate aliases
  - [x] **Impact**: SQLAlchemy aggregate queries now return correct NUMERIC types for mathematical operations
- [x] **Multi-Row INSERT RETURNING Row Count Fix** - Fixed SQLAlchemy INSERT validation errors
  - [x] **Bug Identified**: Multi-row INSERT RETURNING only returned last inserted row causing "did not produce correct number of rows" errors
  - [x] **Root Cause**: `execute_dml_with_returning()` used `last_insert_rowid()` which only returns the last row ID
  - [x] **Solution**: Implemented rowid range queries to fetch all inserted rows using `first_rowid = last_rowid - rows_affected + 1`
  - [x] **Impact**: SQLAlchemy bulk insert operations with RETURNING now work correctly with proper row count validation
- [x] **Date Function Translation Fix** - Fixed syntax errors in parameterized date functions
  - [x] **Bug Identified**: `func.date('now', '-30 days')` generated malformed SQL with nested CAST operations
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Cast translator ran before datetime translator, creating invalid `CAST(julianday(CAST(...) AS INTEGER)` syntax
  - [x] **Solution**: Modified datetime translator to skip translation for parameterized queries containing '$' or 'CAST'
  - [x] **Impact**: SQLAlchemy date functions now work correctly without SQL syntax errors
- [x] **Column Alias Type Inference** - COMPLETED (2025-08-05) - Fixed wrong column types for aliased columns
  - [x] **Bug Identified**: `SELECT users.id AS users_id, users.name AS users_name` returns users_id as TEXT(25) instead of INT4(23)
  - [x] **Root Cause**: Type inference defaulted to TEXT when no data rows available and didn't resolve aliases to source schema
  - [x] **Solution Implemented**: Added `extract_source_table_column_for_alias()` function to parse "table.column AS alias" patterns
  - [x] **Implementation**: Enhanced type inference to call `db.get_schema_type(table, column)` for resolved aliases

### 🚀 Performance Optimization Phase 1 - COMPLETED (2025-06-30)

#### Background
Investigated replacing the channel-based DbHandler with a direct multi-threaded implementation using SQLite's FULLMUTEX mode.

#### Performance Findings
Benchmark results comparing implementations (1000 operations each):

| Implementation | INSERT | SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | Notes |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Raw SQLite | 0.005ms | 0.006ms | 0.005ms | 0.004ms | Baseline |
| Mutex Handler | 0.036ms | 0.046ms | 0.040ms | 0.038ms | 7.7-9.6x overhead (CHOSEN) |
| Direct Executor | 0.038ms | 0.050ms | 0.043ms | 0.042ms | 8.1-10.7x overhead |
| Simple Executor | 0.036ms | 0.047ms | 0.040ms | 0.039ms | 7.7-9.9x overhead |
| Channel-based | 0.094ms | 0.159ms | 0.092ms | 0.083ms | 20-27x overhead |

#### Work Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive research document (docs/pg_catalog_research.md)
  - Documented PostgreSQL catalog table structures
  - Analyzed psql \d command queries
  - Mapped SQLite metadata to PostgreSQL catalogs
- [x] Implemented pg_class handler (src/catalog/pg_class.rs)
  - Maps SQLite tables and indexes to pg_class format
  - Generates stable OIDs from object names
  - Queries SQLite metadata for relnatts, relhasindex
  - Returns all 28 pg_class columns with appropriate values
- [x] Implemented pg_attribute handler (src/catalog/pg_attribute.rs)
  - Maps PRAGMA table_info to pg_attribute format

- [x] Updated CatalogInterceptor to be async and accept DbHandler
  - Routes pg_class and pg_attribute queries to handlers
  - Maintains existing pg_type, pg_namespace support

#### Current Limitations
1. **No Column Projection** - SELECT relname returns all columns
2. **No WHERE Filtering** - WHERE relkind = 'r' returns all rows
3. **No JOIN Support** - Cannot handle psql's complex JOIN queries
4. **Missing System Functions** - COMPLETED (2025-07-04)
5. **Incomplete Catalog Tables** - Need pg_index, pg_constraint, pg_am, etc.

#### Testing Results

- Basic pg_attribute queries work (returns column information)
- psql can connect and query catalogs but \d commands show raw data
- Need proper query processing for full psql compatibility

### 🎯 PostgreSQL Regex Operators Support - COMPLETED (2025-07-08)

#### Background
psql \d command failed with "unrecognized token: !" error due to PostgreSQL's regex operators (~ and !~) not being supported in SQLite.

#### Implementation
- [x] Created RegexTranslator to convert PostgreSQL regex operators to SQLite REGEXP
  - Supports all four operators: ~ (match), !~ (not match), ~* (case-insensitive match), !~* (case-insensitive not match)
  - Handles OPERATOR syntax: a OPERATOR(pg_catalog.~) 'pattern'
  - Preserves query structure while translating operators
- [x] Registered REGEXP and REGEXPI functions in SQLite
  - Uses Rust's regex crate for pattern matching
  - REGEXP for case-sensitive matching
  - REGEXPI for case-insensitive matching
- [x] Integrated into query processing pipeline
  - CatalogInterceptor applies regex translation before parsing
  - LazyQueryProcessor includes regex translation in processing steps
  - Works with both simple and extended protocols

#### Testing
- All four regex operators tested and working
- Handles complex queries with multiple regex operations
- Properly escapes special regex characters
- Performance impact minimal due to lazy processing

### 🗂️ PostgreSQL Catalog Tables Implementation - COMPLETED (2025-07-08)

- [x] Created SchemaPrefixTranslator
  - Removes pg_catalog. prefix from table/function names
  - Allows PostgreSQL queries to work with SQLite
  - Integrated into query processing pipeline
- [x] Enhanced catalog functions

### ✅ Timestamp Conversion for Scalar Subqueries - COMPLETED (2025-08-06)

#### Background
Scalar subqueries and aggregate functions on timestamp columns were returning raw INTEGER microseconds instead of formatted timestamp strings when using psycopg3 text mode.

#### Issues Fixed
1. **Transaction Isolation Bug**: Schema lookups used separate connections that couldn't see uncommitted schema entries
   - Created `get_schema_type_with_session()` function that uses the session's connection
   - Updated all `get_schema_type()` calls in extended.rs and executor.rs to use session-aware version
   - Fixes SQLAlchemy ORM issues with CREATE TABLE followed by immediate queries

2. **Scalar Subquery Timestamp Detection**: Added detection for timestamps in scalar subqueries
   - Pattern detection for `(SELECT MAX/MIN(timestamp_col) FROM table) AS alias`
   - Direct aggregate detection for `MAX(timestamp_col)`, `MIN(timestamp_col)`
   - Added to both ultra-simple and non-ultra-simple query paths
   - Timestamps now properly formatted in simple query protocol

3. **DML RETURNING Timestamp Conversion**: Fixed INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE RETURNING clauses
   - Replaced hardcoded type_oid 25 with actual schema type lookups
   - Added helper functions: `build_returning_field_descriptions()` and `convert_returning_timestamps()`
   - RETURNING clauses now properly detect and convert timestamp columns

4. **Ultra-Fast Path Parameter Casts**: Allow `$1::TYPE` casts in ultra-fast path
   - Modified condition to exclude non-parameter casts but allow parameter casts
   - Enables timestamp conversion for parameterized queries with explicit casts

5. **VALUES Clause Binary Timestamp Handling**: Fixed raw microsecond insertion
   - Detected SQLAlchemy VALUES clause pattern that needs rewriting
   - Convert PostgreSQL binary timestamps (microseconds since 2000-01-01) to Unix time
   - Format timestamps as ISO strings for VALUES clause substitution instead of raw microseconds
   - Normal queries still use raw microseconds for correct storage

### ✅ System Catalog Extended Protocol Support - COMPLETED (2025-07-05)

#### Background
Catalog queries were failing with UnexpectedMessage errors when using the extended protocol (prepared statements). This affected tools that use prepared statements to query system catalogs.

#### Issues Fixed
1. **pg_class Column Count**: Updated from 28 to 33 columns per PostgreSQL 14+ specification
   - Added missing columns: reloftype, relallvisible, relacl, reloptions, relpartbound
   - Updated all related type mappings and handlers

2. **Extended Protocol Field Descriptions**: Fixed UnexpectedMessage errors
   - Field descriptions generated during Describe phase are now properly stored in prepared statements
   - Available during Execute phase for correct protocol handling
   - Catalog queries now work correctly with both simple and extended protocols

3. **Binary Encoding Support**: Fixed "invalid buffer size" errors
   - Catalog data is now properly formatted for binary result encoding
   - Added special handling for numeric columns (attnum, attlen, etc.)
   - PRIMARY KEY columns are correctly identified as NOT NULL

4. **Column Projection**: Implemented for pg_attribute handler
   - SELECT specific columns now returns only those columns
   - Handles wildcard (*) and column aliases correctly
   - Fixed test failures related to column index mismatches

5. **Test Infrastructure**: Improved diagnostic test handling
   - Trace tests that intentionally panic are now marked with #[ignore]
   - Can still be run manually for debugging with --ignored flag
