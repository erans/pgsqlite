# Cleanup Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
The server was hanging when trying to clean up connections after client disconnect. The issue occurred at the `session.cleanup_connection().await` call, causing the server to become unresponsive.

## Root Cause
The hanging was caused by a potential deadlock in the `ThreadLocalConnectionCache::remove` function, which accesses multiple static DashMaps (`THREAD_AFFINITY` and `CONNECTION_POOL`). When called during connection cleanup, this could create a deadlock situation.

## Solution
Applied two fixes:

1. **Simplified cleanup_connection in SessionState**: Removed the timeout-based approach and simply clone the db_handler to avoid holding locks during cleanup.

2. **Removed ThreadLocalConnectionCache::remove call**: Skip the thread-local cache removal to avoid the deadlock. The LRU cache will naturally evict old entries, so explicit removal isn't critical.

## Code Changes

### src/session/state.rs
```rust
// Before:
pub async fn cleanup_connection(&self) {
    use tokio::time::{timeout, Duration};
    
    self.cached_connection.lock().take();
    
    match timeout(Duration::from_secs(1), self.db_handler.lock()).await {
        Ok(guard) => {
            if let Some(ref db_handler) = *guard {
                db_handler.remove_session_connection(&self.id);
            }
        }
        Err(_) => {
            warn!("Failed to acquire db_handler lock for cleanup within timeout");
        }
    }
}

// After:
pub async fn cleanup_connection(&self) {
    self.cached_connection.lock().take();
    
    let db_handler = self.db_handler.lock().await.clone();
    
    if let Some(ref handler) = db_handler {
        handler.remove_session_connection(&self.id);
        debug!("Successfully removed session connection for {}", self.id);
    }
}
```

### src/session/connection_manager.rs
```rust
// Before:
pub fn remove_connection(&self, session_id: &Uuid) {
    ThreadLocalConnectionCache::remove(session_id);  // This was causing deadlock
    
    let mut connections = self.connections.write();
    if connections.remove(session_id).is_some() {
        info!("Removed connection for session...");
    }
}

// After:
pub fn remove_connection(&self, session_id: &Uuid) {
    // Skip thread-local cache removal to avoid potential deadlock
    debug!("Removing connection for session {}", session_id);
    
    let mut connections = self.connections.write();
    if connections.remove(session_id).is_some() {
        info!("Removed connection for session...");
    }
}
```

### src/main.rs
Re-enabled the cleanup call:
```rust
// Clean up session connection explicitly
info!("Cleaning up session connection for {}", connection_info);
session.cleanup_connection().await;
```

## Testing
Verified the fix with multiple test scenarios:
- Simple connect/disconnect cycles
- Multiple concurrent connections
- Connections with active queries
- Connections with transactions

All tests pass successfully, and server logs show proper cleanup:
```
Cleaning up session connection for unix-socket
Removed connection for session f5972fbe-9c99-4685-8316-cd2b6f7bcd1e (remaining connections: 0)
Connection from unix-socket closed
```

## Impact
- No more server hangs on client disconnect
- Proper resource cleanup
- Thread-local cache entries will be evicted naturally via LRU policy
- No performance impact on normal operations
