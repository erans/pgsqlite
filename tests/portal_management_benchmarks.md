## Configuration and Usage

### Default Configuration
```rust
// Portal Manager Settings (per session)
max_portals: 100,           // Maximum concurrent portals
lru_eviction: true,         // Automatic cleanup when limit reached
stale_cleanup: true,        // Background cleanup of unused portals
result_caching: true,       // Cache results for partial fetching
```

### Usage Examples

#### Memory-Efficient Large Query Processing
```sql
-- Client creates portal with Parse/Bind
PARSE portal_name "SELECT * FROM large_table ORDER BY id"
BIND portal_name

-- Process in chunks with Execute max_rows
EXECUTE portal_name 1000  -- Returns first 1000 rows + PortalSuspended
EXECUTE portal_name 1000  -- Returns next 1000 rows + PortalSuspended  
EXECUTE portal_name 1000  -- Returns next 1000 rows + CommandComplete

-- Portal automatically cleaned up or reused
CLOSE portal_name
```

#### Concurrent Portal Operations
```sql  
-- Multiple independent portals per session
PARSE report_portal "SELECT * FROM analytics WHERE date >= $1"
PARSE user_portal "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true"  
PARSE order_portal "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = $1"

-- Each portal maintains independent execution state
-- Concurrent access is thread-safe and efficient
-- LRU eviction manages resource limits automatically
```

## Benchmark Execution

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run complete portal management validation
./tests/runner/run_portal_validation.sh

# Run performance benchmarks
