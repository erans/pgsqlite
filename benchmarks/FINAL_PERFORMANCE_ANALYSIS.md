## Key Findings

### The RETURNING Optimization Paradox
1. **INSERT regressed 3.4x** (0.177ms → 0.596ms)
2. **UPDATE regressed 2x** (0.046ms → 0.095ms)
3. **DELETE regressed 67%** (0.036ms → 0.060ms)
4. **SELECT improved 21%** (3.701ms → 3.031ms)

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Why INSERT Performance Degraded
The benchmark uses `INSERT ... RETURNING id`, which means:
1. Every INSERT now goes through RETURNING detection
2. Even with optimization, we're checking for RETURNING on every INSERT
3. The overhead of checking (even optimized) is ~0.4ms per query

#### Why The Optimization Didn't Help Much
Despite heavy optimizations:
- Only checking RETURNING for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (not SELECT)
- Using SIMD-optimized memchr
- Simplified pattern matching
- Early bail-out strategies

The performance is still poor because:
1. **Pattern matching overhead**: Even optimized checks take time
2. **Multiple searches**: We still search for many patterns sequentially
3. **Branch prediction**: The additional conditional logic hurts CPU pipelining
4. **Cache effects**: More code = more instruction cache misses

### The Fundamental Problem
The fast path detector has become too complex. We're doing too many checks:
- Type casts (`::`)
- Regex operators (`~`)
- Schema prefixes (`pg_catalog`)
- Array operations (`[]`, `ANY`, `ALL`)
- Special SQL features (`USING`, `AT TIME ZONE`, `NOW()`)
- RETURNING clause detection
- UPDATE FROM patterns
- DateTime patterns in INSERT
- JOIN, UNION, subqueries

Each check adds overhead that compounds over thousands of queries.

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Query Type Specialization
Instead of one monolithic fast path checker, have specialized checkers:
```rust
match query_type {
    QueryType::SimpleSelect => check_simple_select(query),
    QueryType::SimpleInsert => check_simple_insert(query),
    // ...
}
```

### Approach 2: Caching Pattern Match Results
Cache the fast path decision for queries:
```rust
static FAST_PATH_CACHE: LruCache<QueryHash, bool> = ...;
```

### Approach 3: Probabilistic Fast Path
Use bloom filters or other probabilistic data structures to quickly reject complex queries.

### Approach 4: JIT Compilation
Compile query patterns to machine code for faster matching.

## Recommendation

The RETURNING optimization is architecturally correct but the implementation shows that the fast path detector itself has become a bottleneck. The solution isn't to optimize individual checks but to rethink the entire approach.

**Best immediate action**: Revert the RETURNING optimization for now and focus on:
1. Profiling with hardware performance counters
2. Redesigning the fast path architecture
3. Implementing query-specific optimizations

The 3.4x regression in INSERT performance is unacceptable for production use.
