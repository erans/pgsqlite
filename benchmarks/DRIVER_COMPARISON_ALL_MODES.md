- Binary mode reduces overhead by **49%** compared to text mode

### 3. Cache Effectiveness
- psycopg2: 1.8x speedup from caching
- psycopg3-text: 0.7x speedup (cache actually slower)
- psycopg3-binary: 0.4x speedup (cache significantly slower)
- **Note**: Cache effectiveness issues need investigation across all drivers

### 4. Operation-Specific Performance
- **Best for SELECT**: psycopg3-binary (0.139ms)
- **Best for UPDATE**: psycopg2 (0.052ms) 
- **Best for DELETE**: psycopg2 (0.032ms)
- **Best for CREATE**: psycopg3-binary (0.810ms)
- **Most consistent**: psycopg3-binary

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Use psycopg3-binary** for read-heavy workloads (19x faster SELECT than psycopg2)
2. **Use psycopg3-binary** for general purpose (lowest overall overhead)
3. **Consider psycopg2** only for legacy compatibility

### Performance Optimization Priorities
1. **Fix cache ineffectiveness** - All drivers show poor cache performance
2. **Optimize INSERT operations** - Still high overhead across all drivers
3. **Investigate binary protocol** - Can more types benefit from binary encoding?

### Migration Path
For existing psycopg2 users:
1. **Immediate**: Switch to psycopg3-text for 38% performance improvement
2. **Optimal**: Switch to psycopg3-binary for 69% performance improvement
3. **Testing**: Ensure application compatibility with binary format handling

## Technical Notes

### Binary Protocol Benefits
The psycopg3-binary mode provides better performance through:
- Reduced parsing overhead for numeric types
- Native binary representation for integers, floats, booleans
- More efficient data transfer for large result sets
- Direct type mapping without text conversion

### Limitations
- Binary protocol requires more complex type handling in pgsqlite
- Not all PostgreSQL types are fully supported in binary mode
- Some types (NUMERIC, arrays, network types) still use text representation

## Conclusion

psycopg3 with binary protocol represents the optimal driver choice for pgsqlite, providing:
- **5x better SELECT performance** than psycopg2
- **69% reduction in overall overhead**
- **More consistent performance** across operations

The binary protocol's efficiency in handling common data types makes it ideal for production deployments where performance is critical.
