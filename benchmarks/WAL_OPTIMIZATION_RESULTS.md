# WAL Checkpoint Optimization Results

## Summary

Implemented intelligent WAL checkpoint mechanism that reduces checkpoint frequency based on:
- Number of commits since last checkpoint (threshold: 100)
- Time since last checkpoint (threshold: 10 seconds) 
- WAL file size growth (threshold: 1000 pages)

## Performance Comparison

### Before Optimization (Schema Batching)
```
SELECT:          0.663ms (45,648.9% overhead)
SELECT (cached): 0.079ms (792.9% overhead)
INSERT:          0.163ms (4,772.9% overhead)
UPDATE:          0.053ms (2,591.1% overhead)
DELETE:          0.033ms (1,560.5% overhead)
```

### After WAL Optimization
```
SELECT:          0.657ms (45,275.3% overhead) - 0.9% improvement
SELECT (cached): 0.081ms (700.1% overhead) - 10.6% worse
INSERT:          0.072ms (1,933.7% overhead) - 55.8% improvement ✓
UPDATE:          0.062ms (2,479.5% overhead) - 4.3% worse
DELETE:          0.040ms (2,138.0% overhead) - 21.2% worse
```

## Key Findings

1. **Significant INSERT Performance Improvement**: 55.8% better (0.163ms → 0.072ms)
   - WAL checkpoint optimization greatly benefits write-heavy operations
   - Reduced checkpoint frequency means less I/O overhead during INSERTs

2. **Mixed Results for Other Operations**:
   - SELECT: Minimal improvement (0.9%)
   - UPDATE/DELETE: Slight regression (4-21% worse)
   - Cached SELECT: 10.6% worse

3. **Trade-offs**:
   - The optimization trades some read consistency overhead for better write performance
   - Less frequent checkpoints mean connections may need to read more WAL data
   - This explains the slight regression in some operations

## Optimization Details

The implementation changed from:
- **Before**: PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE) on every connection after each COMMIT
- **After**: Intelligent checkpointing based on thresholds:
  ```rust
  // Checkpoint only when:
  commits >= 100 || 
  time_since_checkpoint >= Duration::from_secs(10) ||
  wal_size > last_size + 1000
  ```

## Conclusion

The WAL checkpoint optimization successfully improved write performance (especially INSERT operations) by reducing checkpoint frequency. While there are minor regressions in some read operations, the overall trade-off is beneficial for write-heavy workloads.

For applications with balanced read/write workloads, the thresholds could be tuned:
- Lower commit threshold (e.g., 50) for better read consistency
- Higher thresholds for write-heavy applications
