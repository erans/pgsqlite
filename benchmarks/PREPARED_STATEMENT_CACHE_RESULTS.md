# Prepared Statement Cache Optimization Results

## Summary

Implemented a global prepared statement cache at the PostgreSQL protocol level to avoid re-parsing identical queries. The cache stores parsed and translated prepared statements with LRU eviction and TTL support.

## Implementation Details

1. **Global Cache**: 1000 statement capacity with 5-minute TTL
2. **Cache Key**: Query text + parameter types
3. **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic invalidation on DDL operations (CREATE/DROP/ALTER TABLE)
4. **Metrics**: Integrated with existing cache status logging

## Performance Results

### Comparison with Previous Optimization (WAL)

| Operation | WAL Optimized | With Prepared Cache | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| SELECT | 0.657ms | 0.630ms | **4.1%** |
| SELECT (cached) | 0.081ms | 0.066ms | **18.5%** |
| INSERT | 0.072ms | 0.057ms | **20.8%** |
| UPDATE | 0.062ms | 0.062ms | 0% |
| DELETE | 0.040ms | 0.032ms | **20.0%** |

### Overall Optimization Progress

Starting from the severe regression:
- **Initial**: SELECT 4.016ms (389,541.9% overhead)
- **After All Optimizations**: SELECT 0.630ms (38,275.7% overhead)
- **Total Improvement**: **84.3%** reduction

## Key Benefits

1. **Parsing Overhead Reduction**: Eliminates re-parsing of identical queries
2. **Translation Caching**: Cached statements include pre-translated queries
3. **Type Information**: Parameter types are cached, avoiding repeated type analysis
4. **DDL Safety**: Automatic invalidation ensures cache consistency

## Code Changes

1. Created `PreparedStatementCache` with LRU eviction and TTL
2. Added global `GLOBAL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_CACHE` instance
3. Modified `handle_parse` to check cache before expensive parsing
4. Added cache invalidation in DDL operations
5. Integrated metrics into existing cache status logging

## Conclusion

Prepared statement caching provides meaningful improvements, especially for:
- Cached queries (18.5% improvement)
- INSERT operations (20.8% improvement)
- DELETE operations (20.0% improvement)

While the improvement is modest compared to earlier optimizations, it's a valuable addition that reduces CPU overhead and improves response times for applications that repeatedly execute the same queries with different parameters.

Combined with all previous optimizations, we've achieved an 84.3% reduction in SELECT overhead from the initial regression.
