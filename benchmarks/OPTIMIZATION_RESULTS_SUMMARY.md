# pgsqlite Performance Optimization Results Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the results of three performance optimizations implemented to address the severe performance regression in pgsqlite (568x overhead for SELECT operations).

## Baseline Performance (Before Optimizations)
- SELECT: ~383,068.5% overhead (3.827ms) - **568x worse than target**
- SELECT (cached): ~3,185.9% overhead (0.159ms) - **3.5x worse than target**
- UPDATE: ~5,368.6% overhead (0.063ms) - **105x worse than target**
- DELETE: ~4,636.9% overhead (0.045ms) - **130x worse than target**
- INSERT: ~10,753.0% overhead (0.174ms) - **294x worse than target**

## Optimization #1: Fast Path Query Detection
**Implementation**: Added byte-level query detector to skip LazyQueryProcessor for simple queries
- Created `is_fast_path_simple_query()` function using memchr for fast pattern matching
- Modified all query execution paths to bypass LazyQueryProcessor entirely for simple queries

**Results (Mixed)**:
- INSERT: 0.181ms avg (+12,365.5% overhead) - Slightly worse
- UPDATE: 0.046ms avg (+1,940.9% overhead) - **55% improvement**
- DELETE: 0.038ms avg (+1,807.3% overhead) - **16% improvement**
- SELECT: 3.824ms avg (+349,265.8% overhead) - No improvement
- SELECT (cached): 0.175ms avg (+1,896.6% overhead) - Slightly worse

## Optimization #2: Thread-Local Connection Cache
**Implementation**: Reduced mutex contention with thread-local LRU cache
- 32-entry LRU cache per thread
- Checks thread-local cache before global HashMap

**Results (Thread-local cache active)**:
- INSERT: 0.177ms avg (+13,026.8% overhead) - Similar to opt #1
- UPDATE: 0.046ms avg (+2,049.8% overhead) - Similar to opt #1
- DELETE: 0.036ms avg (+1,707.6% overhead) - Similar to opt #1
- SELECT: 3.701ms avg (+305,952.6% overhead) - Slight improvement
- SELECT (cached): 0.111ms avg (+1,147.7% overhead) - **57% improvement**

## Optimization #3: RETURNING Clause Support in Fast Path
**Implementation**: Allow simple DML with RETURNING in fast path
- Added `is_simple_returning_clause()` to detect simple RETURNING patterns
- Modified fast path detector to allow DML with simple RETURNING (column names only)
- Excludes complex RETURNING with expressions, functions, or casts

**Results (All optimizations active)**:
- INSERT: 0.593ms avg (+18,111.1% overhead) - **Much worse** (3.3x regression)
- UPDATE: 0.094ms avg (+4,236.8% overhead) - **2x worse** than opt #1/2
- DELETE: 0.058ms avg (+2,973.4% overhead) - **60% worse** than opt #1/2
- SELECT: 2.724ms avg (+192,983.7% overhead) - **26% improvement** from opt #2
- SELECT (cached): 0.168ms avg (+1,798.5% overhead) - **51% worse** than opt #2

## Summary

### What Worked
1. **Thread-local cache**: Reduced SELECT (cached) overhead from 1,896% to 1,147% (57% improvement)
2. **Fast path for UPDATE/DELETE**: Reduced overhead by ~55% and ~16% respectively

### What Didn't Work
1. **RETURNING optimization**: Made INSERT performance 3.3x worse
2. **Overall INSERT performance**: Remains extremely poor across all optimizations
3. **SELECT performance**: Still 192,983% overhead despite improvements

### Key Findings
1. The RETURNING optimization appears to have introduced a regression that affects all operations
2. Thread-local caching shows promise but needs refinement
3. The fast path detection helps UPDATE/DELETE but not INSERT/SELECT
4. Performance is still far from the target goals

### Recommendations
1. **Revert RETURNING optimization**: It caused significant regression
2. **Profile INSERT path**: Understand why INSERT has 18,000% overhead
3. **Investigate SELECT overhead**: Even with fast path, SELECT is extremely slow
4. **Consider connection pooling**: May help more than thread-local caching
5. **Add query plan caching**: Could help repeated queries beyond row description caching

## Target vs Current Performance
| Operation | Target Overhead | Current Overhead | Gap |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-----|
| SELECT | ~674.9x | ~192,983.7% | 286x worse |
| SELECT (cached) | ~17.2x | ~1,798.5% | 104x worse |
| UPDATE | ~50.9x | ~4,236.8% | 83x worse |
| DELETE | ~35.8x | ~2,973.4% | 83x worse |
| INSERT | ~36.6x | ~18,111.1% | 495x worse |

The optimizations have not achieved the target performance levels and further investigation is needed.
