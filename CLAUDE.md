# pgsqlite Project Context

## Overview
pgsqlite is a PostgreSQL protocol adapter for SQLite databases. It allows PostgreSQL clients to connect to and query SQLite databases using the PostgreSQL wire protocol.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Main source code directory
  - `lib.rs` - Main library entry point
  - `protocol/` - PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation
  - `session/` - Session state management
  - `query/` - Query execution handlers
- `tests/` - Test files
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust project configuration
- `TODO.md` - Comprehensive task list for future development

## Build Commands
- `cargo build` - Build the project
- `cargo test` - Run tests
- `cargo run` - Run the project

## Development Workflow
- After implementing any feature, always run the full test suite with `cargo test` to ensure nothing is broken
- **ALWAYS update TODO.md when completing work or discovering new tasks**:
  - Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
  - Add new discovered tasks or subtasks
  - Document partial progress with detailed notes
  - Update task descriptions if implementation reveals complexity
- Check TODO.md for prioritized tasks when planning development work
- Use TODO.md as the authoritative source for tracking all future work

## Code Style
- Follow Rust conventions
- Use existing imports and patterns
- Avoid adding comments unless necessary
- Keep code concise and idiomatic

## Recent Work (Condensed History)
- Implemented comprehensive PostgreSQL type support (40+ types including ranges, network types, binary types)
- Built custom DECIMAL type system with automatic query rewriting for proper numeric handling
- Developed multi-phase SELECT query optimization reducing overhead from ~200x to ~26x for cached queries:
  - Phase 1: Query plan cache with LRU eviction
  - Phase 2: Enhanced fast path for simple WHERE clauses and parameters
  - Phase 3: Prepared statement pooling with metadata caching
  - Phase 4: Schema cache with bulk preloading and bloom filters
  - Phase 5: Execution cache with query fingerprinting and optimized type conversion

## Known Issues
- **BIT type casts**: Prepared statements with multiple columns containing BIT type casts may return empty strings instead of the expected bit values. This is a limitation in the current execution cache implementation.
- **Array types**: Array handling is not yet implemented
- **Extended protocol parameter type inference**: Some parameter types may require explicit casts

## Important Design Decisions
- **Type Inference**: NEVER use column names to infer types. Types should be determined from:
  - Explicit PostgreSQL type declarations in CREATE TABLE statements
  - SQLite schema information via PRAGMA table_info
  - Explicit type casts in queries (e.g., $1::int4)
  - Value-based inference only when schema information is unavailable

- **Decimal Query Rewriting**: 
  - Only NUMERIC types (stored as DECIMAL in SQLite) require decimal_from_text wrapping for aggregates
  - FLOAT types (REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION, FLOAT4, FLOAT8) should NOT be wrapped as they're already decimal-compatible
  - Correlated subqueries must inherit outer context to recognize outer table columns
  - Context merging is essential for proper type resolution in nested queries

## Quality Standards
To avoid idiot behavior:
- Write tests that actually verify functionality, not tests that are designed to pass easily
- Only mark tasks as complete when they are actually finished and working
- Test edge cases and error conditions, not just happy paths
- Verify implementations work end-to-end, not just in isolation
- Don't claim something works without actually testing it

## Database Handler Architecture (2025-06-30)

### Background
The initial implementation used a channel-based approach with a dedicated thread for SQLite operations. This provided thread safety but introduced significant performance overhead (~20-30x vs raw SQLite).

### Performance Investigation
Multiple approaches were benchmarked:
- **Channel-based DbHandler**: ~20-27x overhead (original implementation)
- **Direct Executor with RwLock pool**: ~8.1-10.7x overhead
- **Simple Executor**: ~7.7-9.9x overhead 
- **Mutex-based Handler**: ~7.7-9.6x overhead (best performance)

### Final Architecture Decision
After extensive benchmarking, we chose a **Mutex-based implementation** as the sole database handler:

**Reasons for this choice:**
1. **Best Performance**: 2.2-3.5x faster than the channel-based approach
2. **Simplicity**: Single connection with Mutex is simpler than connection pooling
3. **Thread Safety**: Achieved through `parking_lot::Mutex` + SQLite's FULLMUTEX mode
4. **Minimal Overhead**: Nearly identical performance to more complex implementations

**Implementation details:**
- Uses `parking_lot::Mutex` for efficient synchronization
- Single `rusqlite::Connection` with `SQLITE_OPEN_FULL_MUTEX` flag
- Maintains schema cache for performance
- Supports fast path optimization for simple queries
- All database operations are async-compatible despite synchronous SQLite

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- Single connection means no parallel reads (acceptable for most use cases)
- Mutex contention under very high load (mitigated by fast path optimization)

## Performance Progress Update (2025-06-30)

### Work Completed
1. **Successfully replaced channel-based implementation with Mutex-based DbHandler**
   - Achieved 2.2-3.5x performance improvement as planned
   - Resolved thread safety issues using `parking_lot::Mutex` + SQLite FULLMUTEX
   - Cleaned up all experimental implementations

2. **Fixed all test failures**
   - Resolved intermittent failures by using `cache=private` for in-memory databases
   - Fixed value encoding to return text format in simple query protocol
   - Implemented proper boolean conversion (SQLite 0/1 → PostgreSQL f/t)
   - Fixed parameter type inference in extended protocol tests

### Real-World Performance Analysis
Full benchmark results (`./run_benchmark.sh -b 500 -i 5000`) show higher overhead than isolated tests:
- **Overall**: ~100x overhead vs raw SQLite (10,212.5%)
- **By operation**:
  - INSERT: ~200x slower (19,759.7% overhead) 
  - SELECT: ~98x slower (9,788.9% overhead)
  - DELETE: ~47x slower (4,749.0% overhead)
  - UPDATE: ~34x slower (3,437.8% overhead)

The discrepancy between isolated tests (7.7-9.6x) and full benchmarks (100x) is due to:
- Protocol overhead from PostgreSQL wire protocol
- Schema metadata lookups for type information
- Query rewriting for decimal support
- Boolean value conversions
- Parameter processing in extended protocol

### SELECT Query Performance Deep Dive
SELECT queries show the second-worst performance (~98x overhead) due to:

1. **Query Processing Overhead**
   - Full SQL parsing for every query execution
   - Decimal query rewriting even for non-decimal tables
   - No query plan caching

2. **Type System Overhead**
   - Schema lookups in `__pgsqlite_schema` for each query
   - Boolean conversion for every row (0/1 → f/t)
   - Text encoding of all values in simple protocol

3. **Fast Path Limitations**
   - Current fast path only handles simple queries without WHERE clauses
   - Parameterized queries always use slow path
   - No optimization for repeated queries

**Phase 6 Achievements:**

- ✅ Created zero-copy message construction infrastructure
- ✅ Added result set caching for frequently executed queries
- ✅ Proper FieldDescription format codes based on Portal preferences

**Performance Analysis:**
While we haven't achieved the initial 10-20x overhead target, the current performance is reasonable for a protocol adapter:
- Protocol translation overhead is inherent and unavoidable
- Network stack latency exists even for local connections
- Type system conversions between SQLite and PostgreSQL add overhead
- The 35-40x overhead for most operations is acceptable given the compatibility benefits

**Remaining Bottlenecks:**
- PostgreSQL wire protocol encoding/decoding overhead
- Single-row INSERT operations lack batching optimization
- Protocol messages must be serialized/deserialized for every operation
- Thread synchronization overhead from Mutex-based architecture

**Optimization Journey Summary:**
1. **Phase 1**: Query plan cache - 1.5x speedup for repeated queries
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced fast path - Reduced overhead from ~98x to ~23x
3. **Phase 3**: Prepared statement pool - Improved statement reuse
4. **Phase 4**: Schema cache improvements - 15.8x speedup for metadata lookups
5. **Phase 5**: Execution cache - Reduced cached SELECT to ~26x overhead
6. **Phase 6**: Binary protocol & result caching - Further optimizations, 2.2x cache speedup
